# Capstone Project: User Car Dealer Website (React with NoSQL)

#### A React web application that shall render a listing of cars up for sale along with image and details that are relevant to a car buyer (make, model, year, price, odometer reading, miles, detailed images etc.).


- Users are buyers in the market looking for more choices when it comes to buying cars (more choices than what a traditional non-online dealer would provide)
- Allows car purchasing from the confines of one’s home by providing accurate details of the vehicle including accident history, condition and clear external and internal images
- Website allows a car vendor to display his wares and complete transaction with interested parties (who are remotely located)

## Minimum Viable Product
- Persist new car record in Firestore
- Permit Update of existing record in Firestore
- Permit Delete of existing record in Firestore
- Real-time display of cars (data fetched from Firestore)
- Use Flex to list cars

## Additional Features
- Authentication
- Authorization (ADMIN shall have greater level of Privileges such as Delete record, update record etc.)
- Allow user to select a car upon which a “pending sale” shall appear and persist for 3 days or until completion of sale which ever happens first
- Clicking on a car shall take user to “more details” page which shall have more images and additional details pertaining to clicked car.
